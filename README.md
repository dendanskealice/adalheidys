### Goedemorgen!

I write C++ and C# code, almost too much C++ and C# code for my liking, but it earns me the sweet dollars, so I don't mind. In my spare time, I work on and off on, ahem, a freeware Science-Fantasy Action Role Playing Game™️, built on my own engine and free of the whims and wishes of the consumer. Yes, reinventing the wheel is my kink.
